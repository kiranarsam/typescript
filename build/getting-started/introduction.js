/**
 * Introduction to typescript.
 *
 * TypeScript is superset of JavaScript.
 * TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript. First, you write the TypseScript code.
 * Then, you compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code using a TypeScript Compiler.
 *
 * Once you have the plain JavaScript code, you can deploy it to any environment that JavaScript runs.
 *
 * TypeScript files uses '.ts' extension rather than the '.js' extension of JavaScript files.
 *
 * TypeScript ==> TypeScript Compiler ==> JavaScript.
 *
 * TypeScript uses the JavaScript syntaxes and adds additional syntaxes for supporting Types.
 *
 * If you have a JavaScript program that doesn’t have any syntax errors,
 * it is also a TypeScript program. It means that all JavaScript programs are TypeScript programs.
 * This is very helpful if you’re migrating an existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.
 *
 *
 * Why TypeScript????
 * The main goals of TypeScript are:
 * 1. Introduce optional types to JavaScript.
 * 2. Implement planned features of future JavaScript. a.k.a ECMAScript Next or Next to the current JavaScript.
 *
 * 1) TypeScript improves your productivity while helping avoid bugs.
 * Types increase productivity by helping you avoid many mistakes. By using types, you can catch bugs
 * at the compile time instead of having then occur at runtime.
 *
 * TypeScript Compiler will issue an error if you compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript.
 *
 * 2) TypeScript brings the future JavaScript today.
 * TypeScript supports the upcoming features planned in the ES Next for the current JavaScript engines.
 *
 * Summary
 * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
 * TypeScript adds type to the JavaScript and helps you avoid potential bugs that occur at runtime.
 * TypeScript also implements the future features of JavaScript.
